# how does this work?
 the way this website works, and how you see this is powered by a simple markdown parser that displays markdown to html via javascript.
# how do i set this up for me?
 i might make it easier to use this with an separate program, as in "compiling" markdown directly towards html, or just providentiating the javascript code in binary/obfuscated form.
# what will you do in this website soon?
 i will upgrade the markdown parser so i can write things in full detail, separating this in a tab instead of shoving the markdown pages in the topbar, and also make my own personal blog :)
